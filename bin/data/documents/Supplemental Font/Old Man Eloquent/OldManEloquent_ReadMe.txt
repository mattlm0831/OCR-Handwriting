OLD MAN ELOQUENT™

©2010, 2012, 2017 by Three Islands Press

Thank you for licensing Old Man Eloquent™, a member of the 3IP Type Library. We appreciate your business very much.

Old Man Eloquent simulates the handwriting of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of The United States, in pages of his diary circa 1810. Adams kept a diary from 1779, when he was a boy, until 1848, the year he died — a span nearly 70 years. His fairly dense, compact penmanship is quite legible and has a sort of scholarly feel to it. Conveniently, Old Man Eloquent seems to cover a broad range of 17th- and 18th-century scripts, from pirate, to poet, to president. It’s our only old pen font with regular and bold weights (although for authenticity’s sake, I wouldn’t recommend using both in the same text block).

The OpenType release of Old Man Eloquent has nearly 800 glyphs, including stylistic uppercase alternates, numerous historical, contextual, and discretionary ligatures, roman numerals, old-style and lining figures, ink blots, cross-outs, and full Latin support.
